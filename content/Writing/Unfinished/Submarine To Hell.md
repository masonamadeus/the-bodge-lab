“PRESSURE’S ON!” Gilstead howled, as he threw the thick metal lever upwards.

A sudden, violent jerk of the vessel sent him staggering sideways into a wall of pipes.

“Fuck YES!"

A deep baritone crackled from the headset, which was now lying on the floor under an errant rolling toolbox.

"I could tongue kiss you right now, Gil.”

Gilstead clambered to his feet, absently running a hand along the back of his head to check for blood. 

Making his way across the engine room, he peered at an array of gauges dancing in the red klaxon glare; watching with solemn resignation as the bottommost layer of habitation units began to report fatally low oxygen and temperature.

“This buys us at least another thousand fathoms. You’re a genius. I don’t know how you do it,” the voice in the headset carried on.

The needles hit their bottom stops. Small red indicator lights began to parade as mechanical bulkheads permanently sealed off the lowest level; the emergency systems proclaiming it a total loss.

A dot matrix printer spooled up. Gilstead turned his head towards the sound, and watched as the automated logbook struck out the names of the deceased. All with the same time of death, as reported by the sub’s computer when it blocked off the chambers. But he knew that many of them would just be waking up now. Even in stasis, the human brain’s panic at a lack of oxygen can’t be repressed. So many of them would, right now, be bolting awake and choking. Trapped in a small plastic cylinder, ice cold - and growing colder by the moment, in absolute darkness and silence.

10 minutes, at most. The only relief being the last four to six would be imperceptible to them.

Gilstead shivered at the thought.

Is this perhaps, a sci fi deep-sea submarine in murderously cold waters, transporting thousands of bodies (kept in stasis) to hell? Something bad is happening, the engines are failing as they cannot compete with the pressure of the waters above them. They are determined to get to hell. Is this a cult? Is the voice in the headset Mors?
