### DOCTORS HATE HIM FOR THIS 1 SIMPLE TRICK

{%react "breakdown"%}

Why is it so hard to create on my own?

I'm sitting in a studio of my own, loaded up with equipment and instruments that child-me would have killed for. If I had a time machine and brought my 16-year-old self in here he would be completely fucking floored.

It's not like I don't have ideas, I have loads of ideas; so many ideas. There is an infinite list of things I'd like to make, but I can't bring myself to actually do any of them. It's not really a fear of failure, or a lack of inspiration that's holding me back.

It's more like a craving.

I just don't know for what. Validation? A collaborator? Someone to mirror my excitement back at me, and let me know this is a worthwhile way to spend my time?

My whole job now is sitting at home and being creative. I have the ultimate free reign to bring my own designs to life, with very few restrictions. But it's not choice paralysis that's holding me back, it's something different. Some unknown, unnamed monster that I'm trying to catch in my flashlight beam.

There's a magic thing that sometimes happens when I'm creating art, where I feel transported to a different space. It's not exactly a {% trigger "flow state"%}. I know we're all chasing that 'flow' and it's awesome when it arrives, but this is a sort of *different* sensation. It's less of "things flow out easily" and more of "I am living inside this creative zone". Unlike flow, I can tap into this sensation at will -- so long as I have a 'place' at hand.
