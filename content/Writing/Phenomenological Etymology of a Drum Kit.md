# PHENOMENOLOGICAL ETYMOLOGY OF A DRUM KIT

If you want to record your own percussive drum sample kit, and you don't know what drums you need, this might help a little bit.

## BARE MINIMUM

1. **KICK** (low bassy, "boof")
2. **SNARE** (mid-high, "crack")
3. **HI-HAT** (short, bright, "CHIK")
4. **CRASH CYMBAL** (long, loud, bright, "PSCHHHH")

## EXPECTED MINIMUM
5. **HI-HAT OPEN** (long, similar to HI-HAT in tone, "tssss")
6. **RIDE CYMBAL** (bright, quiet, shimmery, long, "dtsshh")
7. **TOM 1** (tonal, short, "dunk")
8. **TOM 2 **(slightly lower pitch than TOM 1, otherwise similar)
9. **TOM 3** (slightly lower pitch than TOM 2, otherwise similar)
10. **FLOOR TOM** (tonal, lowest, longer "buhh")

## NICE TO HAVE
11. **CRASH VARIATIONS** (bright, various. "SCHWINK", "BOSH")
12. **CLICKS** (short, sharp, percussive)
13. **SFX/SAMPLES** (anything, percussive is best tho)

# TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

1. Find sounds that start with a sharp, transient beginning (rather than something that slowly builds up)
2. Trim the audio files so that they start right at that beginning transient and end as soon as it goes silent
3. Record in a higher sample rate to allow for cleaner stretching/pitch shifting if you want.
4. Three variations of each sample will result in a nice dynamic sounding kit IMO
5. Anything that makes a cool short sound will probably sound cool somewhere, consider those SFX.
6. Some big longer sounds that DO build up are also cool but they're also SFX
