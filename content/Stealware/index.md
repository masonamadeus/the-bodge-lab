# This folder contains things for YOU

This is where I'll put various production assets, music, programs, plugins, etc. for you to {%trigger "steal and use" %} in your projects!

{%react "steal and use" %}Unless otherwise specified, I'm the creator of all of these and you have my permission to take and use any assets in these folders for your creative projects.{%endreact%}

### I'd appreciate credit by linking to bodgelab.com in your shownotes, description, credits, etc -- but it's not a strict requirement. It'd just be nice. :)

I'll also use this space to create lists of resources (both free and paid) that I like to use, but {%trigger "did not create"%}. Those are in the [Mason's Lists](<Mason's Lists>) folder! {%react "did not create" %} Obviously they'll all have their own license agreements, which you'll be able to find on their respective webpages. {%endreact%}
