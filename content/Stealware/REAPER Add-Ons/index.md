# Mason's Workshop Scripts for REAPER

These are various utilities I have made over the years. Some simple, some {%trigger "more complex"%}. There are a few caveats you should know before you dig in:

1. I am on WINDOWS, and I have only ever used Mac under duress. Therefore, I {%trigger "cannot guarantee"%} these will all work on Mac{% react "cannot guarantee"%} , particularly the more oddball ones involving text-to-speech, FFMPEG, transcription, etc{%endreact%}. However, MOST of these should work just fine!
2. You **must** have the [SWS/S&M Extension for REAPER](https://www.sws-extension.org) installed. Not just for my scripts, but because it offers SO much functionality!

 

{% toggle "How to Add Scripts to REAPER" %}

{%grid%}

- Download the .lua file you want to have and save it somewhere memorable.
- Launch REAPER, and open the Actions menu. (Hotkey: "Shift + ?")
- Select "New action..." and then "Load ReaScript..."
- Use the file browser to select the .lua file you downloaded earlier!
- Profit.

# UNDER CONSTRUCTION

I'm planning on making a {%trigger "nice browsable"%} write-up for each plugin/script with clear descriptions on their purposes and usage. {%react "nice browsable"%} Like a cool, magazine-style browsing experience. Y'know, something nice. {%endreact%}

**I'm still in the process of extracting and uploading these to the Bodge Lab so check back often.**

## For now, look through the folder listing below and read the top of each script for details.
