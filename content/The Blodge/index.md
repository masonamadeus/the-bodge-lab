# Welcome to The blodge

## This is my 'blog' I guess?

I've never made a blog before so maybe this isn't a blog at all. This is where I'll collect my non-fiction thoughts about fleeting things. Current events; passing moods.

An eclectic collection of personal essays and whatever other horseshit I feel compelled to put here.
