# How I Got Like This

Hi. My name is Mason Amadeus. I’m thirty one years old, I have a mustache, and my favorite color has been purple for a long time, but I am starting to come around to liking orange more these days. I hold no formal titles; I barely graduated high school. I did not attend college, but I did apply to one. Just the one.

I can summarize the entirety of my formal education with a single anecdote, which I’m willing to bet will feel relatable to the kind of person who would like my work.

Senior year of high school. I was failing Computer Science, Film Studies, and Algebra 2. Three subjects that I needed to graduate, that I honestly loved and excelled in, but because I had sewn a diaper’s worth of moral hairs across my buttcheeks about how inequitable the very concept of ‘homework’ was, and these classes each weighted ‘homework’ far more heavily than test results, I was floundering with a capital F.

Computer science, film studies, and algebra 2. Graduation was looming. I needed to kill three birds with one stone, and I wasn’t gonna do it on my own time. So I skipped a couple classes, filched a chromebook from an unlocked cart, and created a twenty-six-variable algebraic expression designed to {% reveal "'objectively'", "I remember thinking as a kid that life would be so much easier if you could reduce everything to a mathematical equation. That thought is kind of chilling now, because I bet that's how a lot of the silicon valley technofascists think."%} rate movies based on twenty six criteria that the user would assign a numeric value to. 

{%endreveal%}

Really, the equation was just an overly complicated weighting system based on how much *I* thought various aspects of a film mattered to it’s overall quality. It included things like “the Spielberg-Jackson constant” and other fun tidbits like that. I’ve unfortunately lost the original, but you would rate things like character depth, pacing, the quality of the effects, etc. on a scale of one to ten. Plug those values into the equation and it would spit out what I dubbed the “Overall Entertainment Value” or OEV for the movie. To make it easy to use, I put together an excel spreadsheet that would do the calculations for you. Just plug in your rating numbers next to each prompt, and whambi-bambi -- there’s your OEV.

This project either demonstrated to the teachers of all three classes that I sufficiently understood the subject matter - or they all just felt bad for me but all three of them granted enough extra credit that I managed to scrape by and graduate with a D- in each of their classes. 
To be clear, I think that this story speaks more to the patience and grace of my excellent high school teachers than it does to any brilliance on my part - but it’s certainly illustrative of the way I’ve approached basically my entire life.

## WHY AM I THE WAY THAT I AM

When I was a little kid, I stumbled upon and became obsessed with Homestar Runner dot net. It’s dot com! I remember being so thoroughly enraptured by how I could summon this entire interactive universe through my giant, hot, static-smelling, beige, 1024 x 768 monitor - mere inches in front of my nine-year-old nose. I remember the fervency with which I would rapidly tap the ‘tab’ key while watching, because I had discovered it would highlight clickable easter eggs in the animations. I remember hearing autotune for the first time in “The Skate Party” and wondering how anything could ever sound that cool.

I vividly remember the moment I noticed that the URL bar would display the strong bad emails by number, and thought to myself, “hey, what if I changed that to a number that hasn’t come out yet”. I tried it. I was rewarded with one of the greatest easter eggs in internet history, and from there it was all over.

At the encouragement of local computer guy and father of me, my dad, I made a website in the fifth grade. I used the Coffee Cup HTML editor and an old school FTP program to create a steel-grey, password-protected website for ‘Team Dolfin’; a secret club consisting of me and my only three friends at the time, named after a portmanteau of each of our favorite animals: Dog, Wolf, and Penguin. Funny enough, none of us cared at all for dolphins.

Not much later on, I would discover that I could change the ‘dot html’ at the end of ANY Homestar Runner URL to ‘dot S-W-F’, and download a direct copy of the animation it contained. After obtaining a totally legitimate copy of Macromedia Flash MX using a pretty famous piece of software created by my present-day favorite software developer, Justin Frankel, I began to pick apart my ill-gotten copies of Homestar Runner animations to see how they worked. 

I was a ScanDisk kid with Pentium dreams. Flash was my first exposure to the possibility of digital creation. Strong Bad was my spiritual advisor, and the Brothers’ Chaps were titanesque figures whose footprints left craters I would study with an aspiring archaeologist’s appetite for answers.
Almost all of my early summers and after-schools were spent perched, butt-and-feet-on-the-seat of a wooden kitchen chair, absent-mindedly sucking on the collar of my plain long-sleeved shirt, staring transfixed into the many rectangular eyes of the Macromedia Flash MX editor. And it stared back. Lovingly.

Here are some examples of animations I made between the ages of eleven and thirteen. I had thought they were lost forever; but on a semi-recent Christmas trip back home, I rooted around my parent’s basement until I found the mouldering grey corpse of an ancient Dell computer tower containing the minutely magnetized metal platters which still trapped the fading genomic ghost of my childhood artistic toils.

I won’t pretend they’re all good. Poring through the contents of the recovered hard drive, there are hundreds of near-empty, half-started projects. Only a handful of them extend beyond exploratory character designs or sketches. Just a few of those have any actual animation to them. Of the ones that do, only a few are more than three seconds long.

Something else I learned in digging through these quasi-fossilized files is that I’ve strictly maintained the exact same file organization structure since childhood - if you’ll permit a total lack of structure to constitute a form of structure itself.

What struck me the most however, was how many memories flooded back in connection with the chaos itself. The idiosyncratic folder names set off chain-reacting thunderstorms of memory. Ancient, threadbare synapses in the oldest rooms of my now-allegedly-fully-developed brain began to burn off their dust, and I felt a strange sort of reverse grief.

I think we all occasionally mourn our inner child - or at least the idea of who we ‘used to be’ before self-awareness sandblasted away our rough edges and cultural pressures packaged us into clamshells. Being myself separated from the artefacts of what I have long considered my most foundational work, I had come to grieve and glorify those days as a stinky, shirt-sucking, indoor kid. I thought every aspect of that child was long gone.

While he was definitively not a better person, I would mourn how he was less inhibited by psychic ‘should’s and ‘supposed to’s. How he would create freely and without judgement. How he didn’t second guess if something was ‘worth doing’.
It was a genuine shock to confront the cold, digital, pixel-accurate representation of those days and realize that I have largely not changed in the slightest.

Hidden beneath the near-random cascade of files and folders was a minefield of memory triggers. As I clicked between folders labeled things like “FLASHCRAP” and files with names like “punchinface.swf” and “pwgmpwks2hq” and “SPngebob”, I remembered days spent walking to the Minute Mart or going down to the little skatepark down the road.

Something about being faced, again, with the exact files and folders my younger self spent his free time creating, brought those memories from faded sepia tones to full-color 4k high resolution. Suddenly, the moments in-between were visible again.

I remembered the times I felt defeated. I remembered files that I had deleted in anger at my own perceived incompetence. How I never posted any of these to the internet, because I was afraid of being bullied. I remembered how I bullied myself out of recording my own voice for years, because people in SOCOM II US NAVY SEALS multiplayer lobbies had relentlessly mocked me for the twin crimes of having a child’s voice and not being good at SOCOM II US NAVY SEALS.

I realized that then, just like now, I walked through the world with the assumption that anyone I met would dislike me by default.
I don’t think I showed most of my animations to anyone. 

I would go on to get a full-time job working for a local radio station. I took over the afternoon drive shift, 2pm to 7pm, on a HOT ADULT CONTEMPORARY program, and while I did genuinely love my time there and I would not - if I were to come into posession of a time machine - change a single thing about it, I quickly discovered that I found parts of the job to be a unique kind of unpleasant.

Twenty-something Mason had everything to prove, and nothing in common with the middle-aged, on-the-way-to-soccer-practice target audience. I did not want to talk about how much money the twelve days of christmas would cost this year, accounting for inflation. I did not want to insinuate that if you could just sit through two maroon five songs and five minutes of commercials, I would reveal the knowledge of which three foods could ruin your marriage. But I did. I insinuated that and many other things like it.

After spending years being ashamed of my voice, I had immediately sold the first thing I finally found to like about it. I'm always keeping my work at arms length, and I'm only now realizing that I should probably talk to a therapist about this.
