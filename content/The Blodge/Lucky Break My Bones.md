# Lucky Break My Bones

## Or: How To Stress Yourself Out of Success

The "Indie Creator Dream" -- as far as I can tell -- is to make a Thing™, and then have that Thing™  somehow garner enough attention to become your job in a way that sustains you. 

That's not what happened to me. Rather, I made a Thing™ that is NOT {%trigger "popular"%}, but happened to catch the attention of someone who then hired me to make a Different Thing™ with the goal of garnering enough attention to have it become our job. 

I didn't realize how underprepared I was for {%trigger "that permutation"%} of pressures.

{%react "that permutation" %}Burnout, impostor syndrome, general insecurity and more are always lurking in the shadowed corners of professional artistic work. I'm not trying to minimize those, and they're all still very present for me. What really struck me was the difference *at the jump*.

When something you've already created becomes "successful" (however you define that), you've done the work of creation *before* the pressures of success and momentum are at your back. When you're setting out to create something new, while knowing that your survival and livelihood is tied up in its reception, the stakes feel way different. At least to me. It makes the act of creating art feel less safe. {%endreact%}

Importantly, I should mention that the person I work under is *phenomenal*. Genuinely the best boss I've ever had, and someone I consider a very good friend. He doesn't put any of this pressure on me -- this call is coming entirely from inside my house -- but right now he's floating my paycheck until we can break even and I know we can't do this forever. Every day that passes I feel mounting dread.

I've been stuck, spinning my wheels for a couple of months now, and that pile of guilt and pressure is making it exponentially harder to do things. *Any* things. It's triggering the broken pathways in my mind that tell me I'm a talentless hack who annoys everyone he interacts with. I feel like nothing I have to say is worth saying. And because the work involves my own performance, everything I TRY to make {%trigger "comes across"%} like I've got a gun to my head offscreen.

{%react "comes across"%}I just rewatched a draft that I filmed for a video I want to make about polarization, and it literally looks like a hostage video. I don't recognize myself. I don't recognize my voice. None of "me" comes through, and it's terribly boring and sad to watch. That's not Good Content™.{%endreact%}

I've stalled out on {%trigger "two major projects" %} and cannot seem to bring myself to get meaningful progress done on them. As a result, I'm paranoid that I'm going to lose my gig. When I try to do anything about that - to 'move the needle' by filming or recording something - my heart pounds, my stomach tells me I need to shit *right now*, and my mind kicks into overdrive about all the {%trigger "other things"%} I could be doing instead. 

{%react "other things"%}Suddenly it's time to worry about my double-digit thousands in tax debt. Or my medical bills that have gone to collections. Right now, in front of the camera, or the blinking cursor on the blank page. {%endreact%}

{%react "two major projects"%}The two projects that I've stalled out on are [Digital Folklore](</s/digital-folklore>) and [Wicked Interesting](</s/wicked-interesting>). It's been two years since we released an episode of Digital Folklore, and many months since I released a video for Wicked Interesting.

In the case of the former, we took a break to change our workflow into something more sustainable. We've been trying to figure out what that looks like, but I've been navigating some extreme burnout that has left me unable to make much progress. I think a knock-on effect of that is driving my lack of Wicked Interesting content too. These two projects exist as foils to one another in my head. Working on one leads to guilt about ignoring the other. Instead I perform all sorts of 'background work' that looks like productive procrastination, in hopes of setting up systems for a future self that is never going to materialize. I feel like a hack and a failure, squandering a golden opportunity.{%endreact%}

## Creativity used to be the thing I squeezed into the cracks and corners of every day, and I never struggled to make things. 

I struggled with not having enough *time*, but now that I have the time I cannot bring myself to use it right. I don't know if it's because I have previously worked under extremely demanding leadership, or always in service of someone else's goals and thus cannot see my own as "worthwhile" or what. I don't know how to **just make stuff** anymore.

I should be so lucky to have the position that I do, and I don't feel right complaining, but I think the course I'm on is mentally wrecking me.

{%react "popular"%}The thing that I made which got me my current job is [PodCube™](</s/podcube>). It has an audience of about 300 to 500 people. That's not insignificant, but it's a far cry from "commercially successful". Personally, and this is perhaps one of the hardest-to-swallow parts of the pill, I do not give a shit how many people listen to PodCube™. That never matters to me, because I love making it. I can't say the same for literally anything else, and I don't know why. If I can figure that out, maybe I'll be on the right track.{%endreact%}

At the end of the day, I just want to be a scrappy little artist. Toiling away in my studio. Shaving the tips off of waveforms and tucking fart jokes into scientific explanations. I just want to share my inner world with the outer world, and try to bring joy and light and curiosity to other people. Instead, I've somehow managed to turn my entire creative apparatus into one of those little boxes that switches itself off.
