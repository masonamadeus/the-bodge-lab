# The Computer used to be a place.

Really it used to be a *job* but I'm not writing that pedantic of an essay. Hopefully. I'm not going to attempt to trace a history here; I'm trying to chase down an old, endangered feeling and shoot it from a helicopter like a true intellectual sportsman.

We used to visit websites. 

I used to visit websites! I remember websites; I loved websites!
