# Do it LIVE

I love streaming. I don't do it often, but when I do I love it.

On this page I'll chronicle current and past livestream projects.

## CURRENT

### Join Colin Parker && Mason Amadeus Every MONDAY Night at 5pm EST

We're streaming Human Fall Flat! In 2020 we streamed ourselves playing through the game's initial 10 levels. 

After that, we took a years long hiatus.

Now... we're back and floppier than ever.

Come hang out as we wiggle and waddle our way nonsensically through the fisher-price universe of HFF!

Every Monday @ 5pm EST on Twitch.tv/ColinMParker

Consume foot! Shit, my dad! It's a blast!

## PREVIOUS

I'll come back and update this section eventually. I did a lot of livestream projects for a minute.

For now, you should check out my [Face-Spraying Robot](/s/face-spraying-robot) video! I built a face-spraying robot out of old Keurig parts and garbage, and used it to raise money for a variety of causes.
