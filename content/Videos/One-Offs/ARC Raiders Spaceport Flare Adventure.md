Tucker and I wanted to see how many raider flares we could put out at once. 

Also check out this cool reddit post of a guy launching 168 flares spread out across the map. Their launch is honestly way cooler looking than ours was haha. Here's the link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/c...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbW9sQXNLNnNKNFhuVDU5SDdBT2V1SXB1dVpwUXxBQ3Jtc0ttS3Z4RzJNejBNSVA3UGNkaHA2ZmlKWUpHd0ZoYXlNaUMxRkliQTRsZmZ4RDFiZmlNdFIxNmxYYWFnb1g3bDB5M241STlVQ3hOekZaQWR4clBBdUpsbnhfa2NTTlM4YUFpMmVlNzZ2RVhBcmwxX2xLQQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2FArcRaiders%2Fcomments%2F1qrfofm%2Fcomment%2Fo2oy603%2F%3Fcontext%3D1&v=6gwYHTLWKmA) 

It used to be that you couldn't get flares off of your quick-use wheel once you had placed them, so you could only bring as many as your quick slots would allow.

We specc'd out expecting that to still be the case, but brought along extra flares to test if we could somehow use more than that. Surprise surprise, the latest patch changed the behavior and now you can have an entire loadout full of flares... We might try this again.
