# So Many Cool Tools

Open source software is the best. Obviously. I love to trawl the internet for useful little utilities, and I've collected a lot of them over the years.

Some of these are more well-known than others. I'm making this list partially for my own use, to refer back to when I inevitably have to reinstall my operating system.

Also, I'm a Windows user, and while most of these are cross-platform (and open source means you could compile it for whatever, probably) I'm only using them on Windows so your mileage may vary if you have a different OS.

I'll try to keep this roughly organized, but know this list is subject to change at any time.
