# Alabaster's Haberdashery

## The spinoff from PodCube™ which came before PodCube™!

The only podcast authentically broadcast from the 1800's.

A lonely hat shop in Prumpleshire UK is the recipient of a special new device called a "PodCube™".

During a botched setup procedure, Alabaster mistakenly sets the device to record random three-minute bursts of audio.
