# 109.1 WIDK - iDunnoRadio

``

## Your Low-Grade, Unpaid, Risque Pit-Stain of a Monday Morning Radio Show!

Join Fishstick, Lulu, The Brofessor, and Mulch for your weekly dose of nonsense.

A fully-produced parody of FM "Morning Zoo" radio, blended with a running audio-drama about the station itself and the lives of the hosts. Explicit but wholesome.

The best episode to sample is "56: Bread Song of the Summer" and you don't have to listen in order. As a matter of fact, don't even bother with the first 19 episodes. 

There is a summary of season 1's plot, if you want to catch up on that without slogging through the early stuff.

## This was my first foray into podcasting.

The humor is pretty blue and immature, so be warned.

My favorite thing we did was all the fake commercials. 

I'll put those up elsewhere on the site for people to steal and use if they want, we made like a hundred of em.
