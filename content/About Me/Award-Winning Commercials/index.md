# ADMISSION: I Love Making Advertisements

There's a nasty little goblin deep inside of me that loves advertising.

Not being advertised *to*, but advertising as a **medium**.

I'm not gonna write a whole screed (here, at least) about my thoughts on the marketing industry, and how good advertising doesn't need to be intrusive or terrible, and how it can actually be 'pretty cool' even.

### But this is a page featuring a handful of award-winning advertisements I've created!

# New Hampshire Association of Broadcasters' "Best Individual Radio Commercial"

Every year, the New Hampshire Association of Broadcasters holds a 'meeting' that's a bit more like a big party full of all the broadcast industry folks in New Hampshire.

A lot of stuff goes on at those meetings, but the part everyone cares about is the awards ceremony. There are various categories across radio and television. If memory serves, I took home FIRST PLACE in 3 of the 5 years I submitted.

Also a general shoutout to my home-station, if anyone from MBG is reading this - y'all rock. Miss you <3

Here are commercials I created that won! I'll put them in order according to my personal favoritism.

## Karl Roberts Cuts for Men - Back to School 2017

{% audio "KarlRoberts_GraniteMike2017.mp3" %}

I wrote and produced this entire spot for Karl Roberts. This is my favorite one, I thought the concept was pretty funny and relatable.

Also, everyone loves a good **button**. This is something I've tried to incorporate across all of my productions, actually. If you stick a little callback or tag at the end of something, it makes it subtly more satisfying, complete, and memorable.

At least, I think so. 🤷‍♂️

## Salsa Sisters - General 2020

{%audio "SalsaSisters_GraniteMike2020.mp3"%}

I wrote and produced this spot for the Salsa Sisters. If my fuzzy memory is correct, they won a contest for a free advertising package and my colleague asked me to come up with something special.

I ran around the office with a portable recorder, and got a variety of on-air hosts and salespeople to attempt a tongue twister.

It was a blast, they loved it, and it won "Best Individual Commercial" in the NHAB awards (which were digital in 2020. IDK if we ever got the shiny plaque.)

## Fran's Auto Body - Accident Rap 2016

{%audio "FransRap_GraniteMike2016.mp3"%}

This was my first one! Not my first commercial ever, but the first time we submitted one of my works to the NHAB - and it won!

This one was written by Cherie Metivier (the sales rep for Frans at the time), and then performed and produced by me and my best friend Tucker.

We laid down a fairly rudimentary beat, and just had some fun messing around with the vibe. This is the result.

I apologize for making a radio commercial that includes tire squealing and a crash sound. I didn't know better at the time.

# National Cybersecurity Alliance

In 2025, I helped the National Cybersecurity Alliance with their "AI Fools" campaign designed to raise awareness about AI-powered voice scams.

I produced the radio ads, and also sound designed and voiced the video campaign. The NCA's phenomenal creative director Arturo Morales handled the rest! There were billboards and online interactables involved, it was cool.
