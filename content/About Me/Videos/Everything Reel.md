# Who I Am && What I Do in 136 Seconds

## My friend Aemyn described me as an 'All Terrain Professional Bodge Technician'

And that is how I like to think of myself now. I've got my fingers in so many disparate pies, and I'm just a giant dork for art and production.

I made this reel to try and summarize the kinds of things I do, and how I like to do them.

It's getting a little bit old, I'll need to update it soon.

But for now, enjoy!
