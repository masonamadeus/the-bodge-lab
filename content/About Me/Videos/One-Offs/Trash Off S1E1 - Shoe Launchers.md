## The Hit New Reality Competition TV Show

Tucker & I got bored one afternoon and decided that instead of cleaning out their barn, we would try to make a game out of it. Long story short, we made a TV pilot in the style of an early 2000's discovery show lol.

We have both since moved, but if we ever get the chance to do this again I would love it. I grew up watching the old "Junkyard Wars" TV show and I think its influence is pretty evident here.
