# Your Eyes are Lying, Lazy, Hateful, Wet, and Gross

## I am not an opthalmologist.

I'm not even 100% certain I spelled that word correctly.

Yeah oops, spellcheck says I definitely screwed it up. Oh well.

I created this for the Scavengers Network Independent Podcast Showcase in 2021.

I've also been told that one of the researchers I contacted for permission even showed this to their class (shoutout to Marte Otten at the University of Amsterdam!)

Footnotes:

1. There are actually five types of melanin: eumelanin, pheomelanin, neuromelanin, allomelanin and pyomelanin. The most common type is eumelanin, of which there are two types— brown eumelanin and black eumelanin. Pheomelanin is red/yellowish and can also be present in the iris. Not blue though. Or green for that matter. Neuromelanin is found only in the brain. Allomelanin and pyomelanin are two types of nitrogen-free melanin. I guess that makes them healthier. 

2. The effect that causes your irises to appear blue/green/etc is called Tyndall Scattering. The effect that causes the sky to appear blue is called Rayleigh Scattering. The mechanism by which the effect of 'color-shifting' takes place is different between the two, but the effect itself is roughly the same. Also the sun is not actually impossible. It is, in fact, QUITE possible. Some would say indisputably possible.

3. "Your retina does image preprocessing based on how important it thinks the signals are" is a MASSIVE oversimplification of what your retina does. I can't summarize it well enough, so if you're interested you can read more here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retina#...](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbkx6c0xKNFREZElYcExpaWZmb3dLMnlaT1ItZ3xBQ3Jtc0tuQWR3LXlUTktkbERBQl84Z1RHaU1DZTdSQ3RBNWxGb0dQMlVuZGprbFR1dnhqMjJnZWpfOUlrVnl1R0JRYWhNMWdCUHREaHkyQWd6bjVtb2FmR0xWM1BaWW5rVDZuS0FUSE9aNG05Q0VUYTVBdGNPUQ&q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRetina%23Spatial_encoding&v=iIIOtsEfShc) 

4. The Meyer's Loop actually comes AFTER the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus. This was an honest mistake, I swapped the sentences in my script. Also, the Meyer's Loop wasn't pictured in the illustration I used, and thus makes this part seem slightly misleading in a very minor way. I still could not find a source to detail what the function of the Meyer's Loop is.

5. Your eyes still detect changes in your peripheral vision and relay them to you, but a static image in your periphery tends to fade very quickly which leads to the perceptual "filling in" as your brain uses the more detailed signals it receives from your fovea.
