# Hi! My name is Mason Amadeus.

``

### My pronouns are he/him.

I don't really know how to describe myself succintly. I've had a weird, non-traditional academic and career path.

I am a Destination Imagination alum, and I carry the values and skills I learned from that program as the highest inspiration for what I do.

My personal goal is to try and fill the world with as much harmless joy and inspiration as I can.

The best one-line description of who I am and what I do came from my friend Aemyn. She described me as an...

## **All-Terrain Professional Bodge Technician.**

{%endgrid%}


### I am the creative director at [8th Layer Media](https://8thlayermedia.com/), where [Perry Carpenter](https://www.linkedin.com/in/perrycarpenter/) and I create various shows about the intersections of humanity and technology!

So far, we've made:

- [Digital Folklore](/s/digital-folklore) - an interview/audiodrama hybrid podcast all about academic folklore in the digital age!
- [The FAIK Files](/s/the-faik-files) - the podcast about A.I. for sane people.
- [Wicked Interesting](/s/wicked-interesting) - a chaotic science YouTube channel.

Formerly, I was an IT manager, audio/broadcast engineer, sound designer, junior RF engineer, producer, copywriter, and on-air talent.

For fun, I am a 2D artist/animator, 3D artist/animator, podcast producer, musician, electronics-tinkerer, actor, and general uber-nerd.

I firmly believe in equality, social justice, and kindness. I don't like pretense, or taking myself too seriously.

Let's be friends and make something cool together!

## Here's a demo reel I produced for my friend Josiah O'Knight!
