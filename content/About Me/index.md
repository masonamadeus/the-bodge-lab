# Hi! My name is Mason Amadeus.

My pronouns are he/him.

I don't really know how to describe myself succintly. I've always felt wary of tying my identity so directly to a craft, or a field of study, or to any singular facet of how I like to spend my time.

The best one-line description of who I am and what I do came from my friend Aemyn. She described me as an **All-Terrain Professional Bodge Technician.**

I miss pre-elmo Twitter.

I will finish writing this soon.
