``

This is an album of music that my best friend Tucker and I wrote, recorded, and produced ourselves. This was almost entirely made before I really knew anything about audio, and if I had a time machine (and the {%trigger "master tracks"%}) I would go back and remix it all.

{%react "master tracks"%}I lost ALL of our original files for this when I wiped my old hard drive. I really thought I had backed it all up too. This was one of those moments that really drove home the importance of keeping copies of important digital artifacts.{%endreact%}
