# My First Attempt at Sculpt -> Retopo -> Paint

{%grid %}

**First off, I'm sorry that this is Gary fucking Vee.**

This was for a client gig that never panned out, and as far as I can tell the client doesn't exist anymore so I'm sharing it here. (If you're that client and you want this taken down hit me up, I'll do it.)

This was the first time I tried sculpting a human head. I used the resulting high-poly model to bake some normal maps, and then spent countless hours wrapping the face in quads and stressing out about loops and poles. I think I got it mostly right tho?

Finally, I painted the textures inside of Blender too. Fun fact, if you forget to tick ONE setting, and you accidentally close your texture image, you'll lose the entire fucking thing and have to start over seven times.

I forget what setting it is, sorry.
