# So Many Cool Tools

Open source software is the best. Obviously. I love to trawl the internet for useful little utilities, and I've collected a lot of them over the years.

Some of these are more well-known than others. I'm making this list partially for my own use, to refer back to when I inevitably have to reinstall my operating system.

Also, I'm a Windows user, and while most of these are cross-platform (and if they're open source you could compile it for whatever, probably) I'm only using them on Windows so your mileage may vary if you have a different OS.

I'll try to keep this roughly organized.

## Media Conversion

- **File Converter:** https://file-converter.io/download.html
  A super simple tool that lets you convert media types from the right-click menu. Infinitely time-saving when you want to share stuff online and need to cronch down those filesizes. More convenient but less powerful than Shutter Encoder.

- **Shutter Encoder:** https://shutterencoder.com
  This is the best wrapper around FFMPEG that I've ever found. If you don't know what that means, this thing basically lets you muck about with converting or extracting any kind of audio or video format. It's an absolute must-have.

## Font Management

- **NexusFont:** https://www.xiles.app
I dunno about you but I have almost 2,000 fonts on my computer. Do I need that many? Shut up. This program lets you manage fonts and it's 100% free. It's so much better than manually installing them, and you can activate/deactivate fonts to clutter/unclutter your font-pickers.
