# Adeline's Errant Textbook

The crew is en route to the workshop of Penelope Whiltinham.

Virgil Horne, and unwitting yet passably handsome medical student, fell in love with Adeline and is now leading the group towards the workshop.

### Relevant Parties
- Trendall Inchmuth: rich student who accused Penelope of stealing his work
- Penelope Whiltinham: the student whom my contact Montgomery Blythe told me to check up on. I do not know their connection... I should ask Blythe more.
- Virgil Horne: some random student whom Adeline charmed into leading a distraction for us

### The Whale Heart-Chamber Sensor Suite (WHCSS)

Wielding my patented Whale Heart Chamber Sensor Suite (which I desperately hate to use) I have discovered the following documents spattered with suspicious void residue.

``

- A bill of lading for a suspiciously heavy crate of organs from Witfeld, a mechanical supplier.
- The organ crate was shipped by Silver Thistle, and the agent was Breanna Clipswitch.
- It was delivered to the Carmine Parlor, we should check there next.

``

- A special requisition form for a series of mechanical parts like gears and such from the academy itself. It has a scolding message from **Eunice Throgmonton** the requisitions clerk at the academy.
- The special requisition form listed the objects' purpose as to be for "the development and creation of personalized measures of protection".
- The special requisition form also listed 50 kg of tyvian ore.

### See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Sniff No Evil

Mux used their nose to sniff about the room and sensed some individual's extremely high stress signature. No futher information...

Adeline cracked a window and checked the situation outside. The watch is maintaining an active perimiter. The workshop we are in overlooks the quad, and the hallways are lined with presumably similar workshops on this floor.

Aggie checked the rummaged detritus left in the workshop, in an attempt to ascertain if the watch was aware of what they were looking for or not. It would seem that they mostly did not? One meticulous hand was involved, in contrast with the rest of the scene depicting a phenomenal lack of care on the part of the guards. Who is the meticulous one? The colonel?

### As Above... So Below?

We dropped down from the window of Penelope's workshop with the help of Adeline's climbing gear. Conveniently, Inchmuth's workshop is directly below. We quickly made our way into the window. 

Inchmuth's workshop is a lot more plain. Piles of papers and works in progress.

I unwrapped the WHCSS from it's protective brown paper wrapping, and began reluctantly pumping it with my non-dominant hand. Immediately, the woodstove lit up in my awareness. Papers have been burned recently. We snatched one from the flames.

It was a note penned by Trendle Inchmouth. I've only now realized I've been mangling the spelling of his name.

``

It was not addressed to Penelope, yet it references creation of some kind of muechanical musical device. The kind of thing that would fit the bills of lading discovered in Penelope's workshop above.

Mux sniffed out a coat belonging to Trendle, and the scent of it matched a trace scent upon the bill of lading discovered in Penelope's workshop. This supports the implication that they were associates in this project.

Two facts that can be drawn from the letter that may be relevant: Humphrey is an engineer, and has ties to the Abbey.

{%endgrid%}

Digging deeper through the chaos of Trendle's workshop, I found a book underneath a workbench. "The Conflicting Resonances of Musical Theory".

Flipping through its pages, it appears to be a foreign book that the Abbey would be unhappy to know about. It talks about the purely mathematical reckoning of sonic frequencies and their relationship with void-touched aretefacts and effects. It mentions Holgar devices, and describes them as a mechanism to "protect oneself against magic using musical resonance". It explicitly states that these devices are assembled painstakingly and clandestinely by hand to avoid detection, and only deepest members of the Abbey would be permitted to make use of them.

As we pored over the strange book, we noticed Mux looking perturbedly at Trendle's coat. Adeline sliced off some of the fabric to take with us.

Our distraction wearing thin, we decided to take our leave.

# The Lading Game

### These Hallowed Halls

On our way out, there was a three-chambered metal box that sent my whale heart fluttering crinkily in my pocket.

The puzzle! An old favorite!

Three conditional statements crafting a logic puzzle. We solved it summarily and discovered a BONE CHARM within.

That probably isn't supposed to be in there. As far as prizes go, it certainly is an unconventional one - heretical even. Typically the prize is money, jewelry, or something else of monetary value. Not creepy shit.

Mux sniffed the inside of the box; lo and behold, it would appear Trendle had placed this charm within.

Being a bit of a puzzle-box afficionado, I happened to know the mechanism by which to reset the puzzle. We elected to replace the charm with a note directing Trendle to meet us at The Twin Screw - a terribly local and locally terrible pub - three days from now. Perhaps if we cannot find him, he will come find us.

Off to the Carmine Parlor! Hopefully it isn't closed!

### It Was, Indeed, Closed.

On the way, I had a rousing, socioeconomically fascinating discussion with Adeline about housing. Did you know that some families have more than a single house? How exciting! If only there were a way for one to acquire a home through some means other than heirship.

Presented with the locked doors, we collectively decided to acquaint ourselves with the premises regardless.

I suggested letting Mux float (inexplicably) up to check for open windows on the higher floors as a potential ingress. Adeline and Aggie pointed out that the owner of the parlor likely has a security system.

While Adeline stood guard, Aggie ventured down the alley next to the building and discovered a sizable basement entry. Sizable enough to permit passage of a smallish organ, given that even the smallestish organ remains an object of substantial size. Additionally, there was a large freight winch system near this entrance. This is a curious feature for a local pawn shop. Why would they need to be handling such things?

Withdrawing two thin pieces of metal from my leg, I set to work against the loading door's security. The lock did not present a challenge.

The WHCSS served me yet again (regrettably) in detecting a tripwire which would have presumably cut our adventure short. Avoiding it, we entered the building.

### In Cold Storage

Mux, bearing a lantern, showed us along. Inside was a storage area packed with crates. Adeline's judgement of the quantity of crates leaned towards suspicion.

After some effortful searching, we located the crate which matched the description from the bill of lading that we found in Penelope's workshop. Adeline pried it open using her grappling hook.

Inside was a 'thank you' note addressed to Trendle Inchmouth. Also an organ.

The organ was of immaculate construction, nothing suspicious about it inherently, and it was indeed created by the Whitfeld company. Aggie immediately expressed a desire to take it home with us.

Adeline cracked open a few more crates, and uncovered multiple shipments of quasi-questionable repute. Nothing particularly occult or void-ridden, but the kinds of shipments whose orderers would likely desire discretion.

Unbeknownst to Adeline and Myself, Mux wandered about the storage area assisting Aggie in the theft of several valuable objects while we ascended the stairs into the sales floor proper.

Paying no mind to the various trinkets and oddities strewn about the shelves, Adeline and I immediately made a beeline for the business and shipment ledgers. Tunnel visioned, we devoured their line items. Enraptured by the various listings, it was only at the last possible second we realized that someone was at the front door. The handle was turning.

### I've Been Here the Whole Time

Adeline deftly leapt upon the counter, assuming a casual yet controlled posture as she donned her Kestrel mask. I hate that mask. Her quick thinking and ability to remain calm under pressure however is truly impressive.

Immediately engaging with the intruding woman as though we had planned this entire act from the start, Adeline began to grill our new acquaintance. She implied that we were invgestigating the wrongdoings and explode-doings at the Academy. I believe the woman may have been Brianna Clipswitch - the name of the agent upon the organ's bill of lading.

With surprisingly little pressure, she acquiesced to our demands for details about the shipment of the organ. We proposed that we might take the organ ourselves, and she seemed amenable. Together we decided to have it transported to The Carriagehouse, one of Adeline's "fancy person" establishments.

### Chasing Trendles

The rest of this journal entry will be a bit scattered, as things began moving very quickly.

We were able to touch base with Trendle, and discovered that he tried poorly to cover his own trail by forging Penelope's signature, altering her requisition form, and burning various documents and evidence in his workshop. He and Penelope were not in fact working with each other at all. He only attempted to frame her because he dislikes her. Typical rich boy shit.

Humphrey turned out to be a person in training with the high artificer at the academy, working on these Holgar devices.

It came out that somebody had robbed Trendle of some elements of his research and work. Not just any someone. Adeline's friend. The ambassador of Morley; the queen's younger brother. Aiden Hull.

Fuck.

Well...

Fuck.

And also, additionally,

Woof.

I make that addition in recognition of the fact that Mux seemed to have determined this truth long before the rest of us. Communicating via an extremely messy and indirect game of charades, Mux rollicked about in the embers of the fireplace until her coat was entirely made of ashes. A bit on the nose, but we think she was attempting to tell us that the *Ashen Mongrels* gang had something to do with this.

Upon our return to the FoE Office, we discovered Penelope already waiting for us. Apparently Mux had lead her to meet us here as well?

I'm beginning to suspect she may *not* be a normal dog.

P.S. Don't forget to tell Blythe.

P.P.S. The watch wanted to ask us about "The Gloaming Tide" gang... Should follow up.
