# Making AI Voices out of Garbage && Cheap Animal Calls

## I wanted to know what would happen if I tried to 'train' an AI voice on garbage.

So I busted out my box of noisemakers and set to work.

I had a lot of fun goofing around, and some of the results are really interesting!

Obviously, I don't endorse Elevenlabs, and I wouldn't even encourage you to use it. If you want to know more about AI (without all the dumb hype) you should check out [The FAIK Files](/s/faikfiles).

There was a lot more I could have done, and maybe I'll revisit this kind of thing in the future.

The guitar voice produced some really weird results in additional testing...
