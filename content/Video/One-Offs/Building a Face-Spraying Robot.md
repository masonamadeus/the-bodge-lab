# I built a face-spraying robot out of old Keurig parts

## Ignore the fact that I call myself "Fishstick"

I made this 'in fiction' for my podcast [WIDK - iDunnoRadio](/s/idunnoradio), thinking I would create a sort of spin-off series where I build gadets.

It was a bit of a weird tie-in but at the time I was trying to find a way to shoehorn all my creative pursuits into a single umbrella.

The video still stands on its own, though, and I think you'll get a kick out of watching me butcher this build.

This thing ended up raising over $700 on stream! We used it to raise money for the SNIP showcase, and also for my friend Morgan's Hannukah charity in 2022!

It eventually met its demise when my upstairs neighbor's toilet broke and flooded through the ceiling of my utility closet, coating the *face spraying* robot in sewage. No amount of cleanup would convince me to ever use it again so I chucked it.

Maybe I'll make a new one someday.
