I don't remember why I made this but I certainly did.

For all the complaining that I do about how 'there's a lot of bad audio advice out there' it seems I couldn't resist adding to it.

Anyways, all the advice in this video is amassed from my many many decades of experience in the field and you should trust every single thing I say implicitly.

I have since upgraded from the Tacoma to a newer Nissan, and I think my audio quality has indeed suffered as a result.
