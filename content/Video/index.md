# My Videos

I've got videos scattered all across the internet. I have more google accounts than sense, and have been phenomenally incautious about where I put things.

**Dig through the files and folders at the bottom of this page! I think you'll find some fun things to watch. Some of the videos are unlisted, and the Bodge Lab is the only place to find them (easily).**

If you want to know what I'm up to *currently*, then check out these:

## Main Channels:

- [Wicked Interesting](<Wicked Interesting>) - my chaotic science channel. This has been a lifelong goal of mine to make, and I think you'll love it.

- [Mason Amadeus](https://youtube.com/@masonamadeus) - my personal YouTube channel, which is a messy 'second channel' for various things.

- [The FAIK Files](https://youtube.com/@theFAIKfiles) - The video podcast about AI for sane people. Perry Carpenter & I attempt to look objectively at AI news/developments.

Otherwise, feel free to poke around all the stuff below! 🔽🔽
