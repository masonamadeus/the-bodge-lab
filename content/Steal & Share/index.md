# This folder contains things for YOU

This is where I'll put various production assets, music, programs, plugins, etc. for you to steal and use in your projects!

Unless otherwise specified, I'm the creator of all of these and you have my permission to take and use any assets in these folders for your creative projects.

### I'd appreciate credit by linking to bodgelab.com in your shownotes, description, credits, etc -- but it's not a strict requirement. It'd just be nice. :)

I'll also use this space to create lists of resources (both free and paid) that I like to use, but did not create. Those are in the [Mason's Lists](<Mason's Lists>) folder! Obviously they'll all have their own license agreements, which you'll be able to find on their respective webpages.
