# Windows 2000 Style Popup Textbox

{%image "win2kpopupprev.webp"%}

Fully programmatically created Win2k style popups, in fucking REAPER.

I'm in love.

Titlebar, gradient, button glyphs - colorable fill && text, and SO accurate it's hard to tell from the pic that it ain't real

Plus, it auto-fits the text, which comes from the item name making it EASY TO USE

{% embed "Win2kPopup.txt" %}

Copy/Paste that into your Video Processor Preset and hit save.
