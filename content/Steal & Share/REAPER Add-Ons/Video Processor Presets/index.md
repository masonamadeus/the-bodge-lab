# Video Editing In REAPER

I've made a mission out of trying to do all my video editing in REAPER now. It's genuinely impressive to me just how much is possible! However, the video processor is such a {% trigger "restricted, limited environment" %} that it's hard to call it a 'fully fledged' video editing suite. It's also just a little bit bonkers in general.

As far as I know, there's no way for you to download and import these, so to use them you must do the following:

1. Add the "Video Processor" FX to any track or item.
2. Copy the code from this website using the convenient COPY button.
3. Paste that code into the Video Processor's big black void.
4. Press "Ctrl + S" to save it.
5. Voila! Profitissimo!

I'm also working on a nicer presentation for this part of the website. Right now it's pretty barebones. Check the folder below for the stuff.
